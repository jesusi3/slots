# SLOTS
Hello fellow Gamblers, <br />
The Game Slots, is a Slots-machine where you put leave your money up to chance. Whether you win or lose, who know. Give your luck a try with a press of a button. You realistically can't lose money, the only is up. To play slots, 'click' the button called switch and wait 2.5 secs for your prize to render.  <br />
Remember you only have 5 turns so make them count and pray! After 5 turn you'll be presented with a grand total and an option to play agian. Are you willing to try again?
