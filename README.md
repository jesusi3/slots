# SLOTS
Hello fellow Gamblers, <br />
The Game Slots, is a Slots-machine where you put leave your money up to chance. Whether you win or lose, who knows. Give your luck a try with a press of a button.  <br />
To play slots 'click' the button called switch, then wait 2.5 secs for your prize to render. Realistically you can't lose money. <br />
Remember you only have 5 turns so make them count and pray! After 5 turn you'll be presented with a grand total and an option to play agian. Are you willing to try again?
